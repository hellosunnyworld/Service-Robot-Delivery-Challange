# Service-Robot-Delivery-Challenge
In this project, an algorithm for a service robot delivering objects between cabinets which are
labeled by different AR tags is implemented.The target is to let the robot move from the first
AR tag to the last one automatically. The ids encoded in AR tags imply the direction of next
tag.
